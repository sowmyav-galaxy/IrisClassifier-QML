# QOSF-Assesment-Task-3

**Problem Statement**:
Generate a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) using the iris dataset and try to propose a kernel from a parametric quantum circuit to classify the three classes (setosa, versicolor, virginica) using the one-vs-all format, the kernel only works as binary classification. Identify the proposal with the lowest number of qubits and depth to obtain higher accuracy. You can use the UUâ€  format or using the Swap-Test.

## Some Definitions

**Kernel Methods** - embedding data into a higher dimensional feature space [1] <br>

**Support Vector Machine** - in a feature space where the two classes of data can be linearly separable, SVM defines a linear boundary (representing a hyperplane) between the two classes [1] <br>

**Kernel Trick** - switch between different models that are created by defining kernel functions from the inner product of data points mapped on to the feature space [1] <br>

**Implicit Kernel** - use a classical model that relies on a kernel function and evaluate the kernel using a qunatum computer (inner product of quantum states in feature Hilbert space) [1]
<br>

**Explicit Kernel** - the quantum computer learns the linear decision boundary using a parameterized quantum circuit [1] <br>

**Parameterized Quantum Circuit** - quantum computer prepares quantum state based on certain parameters and measures the result, based on the outcome, a classical computer adjusts parameters in order to minimize a particular function (ie. loss function) [2] <br>

**Swap Test** - method to estimate implicit kernel based on encoder circuit and measure the overlap between two states [2] <br>

**One-vs-All Format** - in this example, for the three classes, there will be three separate binary classfiers each trained to answer only one classification question affirmatively or negatively; works best with few number of classes [3] <br>
